## :ballot_box_with_check: About app

BatQuiz was a small application I made in October 2017 to practice jQuery. It still works on <a href="http://batquiz.dariusz-mazur.pl/" target="_blank">batquiz.dariusz-mazur.pl</a> (with only little content updates) but... well, that was my very beginning.

From the other hand... it may sound stupid, but BatQuiz was realy sentimental for me - because it was my first JS app and because.. yeah, because Batman ;)

That's why I decided to completly rebuild it. And like those years ago it is mostly for treaning and learning reason. And for fun, of course :)

## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Requirement**

    - npm (v7.16.0)

2.  **Installation**

    To install application navigate to app's directory and use npm command

    ```shell
    cd app-main-dir/
    npm run build
    ```

3.  **Developer mode**

    You can run app in developer mode by using command

    ```shell
    npm run dev
    ```

    Application will run on port 1234 (localhost:1234)

4.  **What's inside?**

A quick look at the top-level files and directories in project.

    .
    ├── /src
    ├── .eslintrc
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .prettierrc
    ├── index.html
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    └── README.md

- **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

- **`.eslintrc`**: linter configuration file.

- **`.gitignore`**: excluding rules for git.

- **`.prettierrc`**: prettier configuration file.

- **`index.html`**: Main application file.

- **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

- **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

- **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
